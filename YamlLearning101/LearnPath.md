## *Yaml Rules*
yaml files exten. .yaml and .yml

(:) colons always apply a space after it. 
***
Example " Name<Key>:Kevin<Value> " 

Key -> Name and Value -> Kevin. **ALWAYS** put a space after the between the key colon value.

***
Just like Bash, to add a comment to your code is by adding a hash# symbole and anything after it will be store as a comment. 

Using `#` before the next `input will be received as a comment.`
***
You can use `>`(Folded style) to removes newline within the string.

You can also use `|`(Literal style) to turn every newline within the strinfg into a literal newline.

**Doesn't** allow mutiline comments, you will need to add a # each time.
***
To tag a data as a certain type, simply include `!![typename]` before the value. example line 14
